    <p>Hi Ashley,<br><br>I just wanted to personally welcome you to the Zendesk family. My co-founders and I wanted to create something that was easy and fun to use—something different from the IT and customer support tools out there at the time. I am so humbled by our customers, all using our product to provide better customer support. I want to thank you so much for being here.<br><br>As you get started with Zendesk, I wanted to point you to some resources to help you make the most:<br><br>1) Reach out for help: Our education team has built a library of resources at your disposal. This getting started guide provides the basics or you can dive into our knowledge base for tutorials on everything.<br><br>2) Get your team trained up: Support is collaborative, and we want to make sure that all your colleagues are ready to use Zendesk. We have a fantastic free self-guided agent training course available: Zendesk Essentials for Agents - Online<br><br>3) Come meet us in-person: We have events and user groups all over the globe. Our product experts travel to cities near you to offer free training and best practices to support teams. It’s free, fun, and we buy the drinks :)<br><br>I know that’s probably a lot of information, but our support team is standing by to help. Thanks again for being a Zendesk customer.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Mikkel<br>CEO</p>

    <p>Ashley,<br><br>Do you know who’s awesome? You are.<br><br>Do you know why? Because your blogs are about to get more action than you got on your honeymoon. Thats right, more email collections and more personalized updates than ever before (what did you think I meant?)<br><br>Before you pull your head out of the gutter, answer me one thing. Why did you sign up for Rabbut?<br><br>I ask because:<br>1.) I want to build the best tool that you can possibly get<br>2.) I can’t read your mind<br>3.) Who doesn’t want more action? (Still talking about your blog!)<br><br>And lets be honest, no one wants to spend all night long figuring out how to setup your emails, so take this, it’s a quick start guide: https://rabbut.com/a-hand-held-guide-to-start-on-rabbut/<br><br>If that doesn’t work, hurry up and email me so I can help you solve your problems. That way you’ll have more time for your personal life. (This time I don't mean your blog.)<br><br>Thank me later,<br>Elmer Founder</p>
